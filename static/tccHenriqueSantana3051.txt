SENDAS: Scalable ENrichment for mobility DAta Sets
Recent years of technological advancement and popularization has
grown the availability of mobility data, collected from different sources. 
Analyzing such data is an active research and industrial development field, with a
diverse range of applications. However, trajectory data has also been following
the Big Data trend, and currently existing tools lack of scalability. To cover this
gap, we introduce Sendas – Scalable ENrichment for mobility DAta Sets –, a
new Scala library built around the Apache Spark framework, enabling parallel
and distributed execution for mobility analysis techniques. We present definitions
that extend state-of-the-art notions of trajectory naming, flow calculation
and mobility motif identification, and also conduct comparative performance
evaluation, finding running time improvements of 4 to 6 times when compared
to non-parallel execution.
